@article{Logg2010,
abstract = {We describe here a library aimed at automating the solution of partial differential equations using the finite element method. By employing novel techniques for automated code generation, the library combines a high level of expressiveness with efficient computation. Finite element variational forms may be expressed in near mathematical notation, from which low-level code is automatically generated, compiled and seamlessly integrated with efficient implementations of computational meshes and high-performance linear algebra. Easy-to-use object-oriented interfaces to the library are provided in the form of a C++ library and a Python module. This paper discusses the mathematical abstractions and methods used in the design of the library and its implementation. A number of examples are presented to demonstrate the use of the library in application code.},

abstract = {We introduce a domain decomposition method for simulating 2D external, incompressible viscous flows. In each subdomain that is close to a connected physical boundary, the velocity and the pressure are approximated on a body fitted, finite difference grid. In the subdomain that is far from the solid boundary (i.e., the neighborhood of infinity), we develop a characteristics method to approximate the velocity and the vorticity on a Cartesian grid. The two methods are coupled by means of a Schwarz type strategy. This method is tested by simulating the flow past one or two cylinders. Some tests are performed with moving cylinders. Comparisons with numerical and experimental data illustrate the efficiency of the method. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Impulsively started flow around a circular cylinder at various Reynolds numbers is studied by a deterministic hybrid vortex method. The key feature of the method consists in solving the viscous vorticity equation by interlacing a finite-difference method for diffusion and a vortex-in-cell method for convection. The vorticity is updated along the surface of the cylinder to satisfy the no-slip condition. The present method is basically different from previous applications of vortex methods, which are primarily in the context of random vortex algorithms. The Reynolds numbers of the flows under investigation range from 300 to 106. Numerical results are compared with analytical solutions at small times, and compared with finite-difference solutions and flow visualization results at relatively long times. Satisfactory agreement is found in the evolutions of the separation angles, wake lengths, surface pressure and drag coefficients, streamline patterns, and some velocities on the axis of symmetry behind the circular cylinder. The present hybrid vortex method is highly stable and suffers from little numerical diffusivity, yielding convincing numerical results for unsteady vortical flows at moderately high Reynolds numbers.},

abstract = {Bluff body flows controlled in various manners are simulated with a high-resolution, gridless vortex method. Two-dimensional, unsteady, viscous simulations are utilized to illuminate the physical phenomenon underpinning certain flows of this class. Flows past a rotationally oscillating circular cylinder and flows past an elastically mounted circular cylinder are studied, providing a variety of new insights about these systems. A computational method facilitating longtime, high-resolution vortex simulations is developed whose grid-free nature enables future extension to complex geometries. The significant fluid forces experienced by bluff bodies are of much practical concern and are induced by flowfields that are often complex. The studies in this thesis aim to contribute to the understanding of the relation between wake development and forces and how to exploit this relationship to achieve flow control. A circular cylinder undergoing rotational oscillation is known to experience a significant deviation in forces from unforced flow. Computations from Re=150-15000 verify past experimental observation of significant drag reduction for certain forcing parameters. These simulations also illuminate the mechanism which renders this control effective - a forced boundary layer instability triggering premature shedding of multipole vortex structures. New insights were also provided by studies of flow over a model of an elastically mounted cylinder. A two-dimensional cylinder modeled as a damped oscillator can serve as an approximation to three-dimensional situations such as a cable under tension. Simulations clarified the behavior of such a two-dimensional system and, contrary to a line of classical thinking, revealed an unexpected adaptivity in wake evolution. New scaling is also suggested which better classifies these systems under certain conditions. Vortex methods are well-suited for incompressible bluff body flow in many ways. However, the handling of viscous diffusion causes complications for such simulations. A relatively unexplored approach, the core expansion method, is studied, extended, and implemented in this work in order to balance accuracy with preservation of the gridless foundation of vortex methods. This viscous technique is found to enable long-time calculations that are prohibitive with other techniques while preserving a high level of accuracy.},

@article{Ferreira2007a,
abstract = {The implementation of wind energy conversion systems in the built environment renewed the interest and the research on Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT), which in this application present several advantages over Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT). The VAWT has an inherent unsteady aerodynamic behavior due to the variation of angle of attack with the angle of rotation, perceived velocity and consequentially Reynolds number. The phenomenon of dynamic stall is then an intrinsic effect of the operation of a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine at low tip speed ratios, having a significant impact in both loads and power. The complexity of the unsteady aerodynamics of the VAWT makes it extremely attractive to be analyzed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models, where an approximation of the continuity and momentum equations of the Navier-Stokes equations set is solved. The complexity of the problem and the need for new design approaches for VAWT for the built environment has driven the authors of this work to focus the research of CFD modeling of VAWT on: •comparing the results between commonly used turbulence models: URANS (Spalart-Allmaras and $\kappa$-$\epsilon$) and large eddy models (Large Eddy Simulation and Detached Eddy Simulation) •verifying the sensitivity of the model to its grid refinement (space and time), •evaluating the suitability of using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experimental data for model validation. The 2D model created represents the middle section of a single bladed VAWT with infinite aspect ratio. The model simulates the experimental work of flow field measurement using Particle Image Velocimetry by Sim\~{a}o Ferreira et al for a single bladed VAWT. The results show the suitability of the PIV data for the validation of the model, the need for accurate simulation of the large eddies and the sensitivity of the model to grid refinement. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Benchmark results are reported of two separate sets of numerical experiments on the collision of a dipole with a no-slip boundary at several Reynolds numbers. One set of numerical simulations is performed with a finite differences code while the other set concerns simulations conducted with a Chebyshev pseudospectral code. Well-defined initial and boundary conditions are used and the accuracy and convergence of the numerical solutions have been investigated by inspection of several global quantities like the total kinetic energy, the enstrophy and the total angular momentum of the flow, and the vorticity distribution and vorticity flux at the no-slip boundaries. It is found that the collision of the dipole with the no-slip wall and the subsequent flow evolution is dramatically influenced by small-scale vorticity produced during and after the collision process. The trajectories of several coherent vortices are tracked during the simulation and show that in particular underresolved high-amplitude vorticity patches near the no-slip walls are potentially responsible for deteriorating accuracy of the computations in the course of time. Our numerical simulations clearly indicate that it is extremely difficult to obtain mode- or grid-convergence for this seemingly rather simple two-dimensional vortex-wall interaction problem. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A new method is proposed for simulating diffusion in vortex methods for two-dimensional incompressible flows. The method resolves length scales up to the spacing of the vortices. The grid-free nature of vortex methods is fully retained and the distribution of the vortices can be irregular. It is shown for the Stokes equations that in principle, the method can have any order of accuracy. It also conserves circulation, linear, and angular momentum. The method is based on exchanging a conserved quantity between arbitrary computational points. This suggests that extensions to more general flows may be possible. For the two-dimensional incompressible flows studied, circulation is exchanged between vortices to simulate diffusion. The amounts of circulation exchanged must satisfy a linear system of equations. Based on stability considerations, the exchanged amounts should further be positive. A procedure to find a solution to this problem is formulated using linear programming techniques. To test the method, the decay processes of a single point vortex and of a counterrotating pair of point vortices are computed. Current limitations of the method are discussed. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {A numerical investigation on the particle dispersion in the wake of particle-laden gas flows past a circular cylinder at Reynolds number of 105 is presented. In the numerical method, the Discrete Vortex Method with the diffusion velocity model is employed to calculate the unsteady gas flow fields and a Lagrangian approach is applied to track individual particles. A dispersion function is defined to represent the dispersion scale of the particle. The distributions of gas velocities and vortex blobs, the trajectories and dispersion functions as well as distributions for particles with various Stokes numbers ranging from 0.01 to 1000 are obtained. The numerical results show that: (1) very small sized particles with St = 0.01 can distribute both in the vortex core and around the vortex periphery, whereas intermediate sized particles with St = 1.0, 10 are distributed around the vortex periphery, and very large sized particles with St = 1000 do not feel the gas flow; (2) only at small Stokes number (St = 0.01, 0.1) the particles do not impact with the cylinder; (3) the particle's dispersion intensity decreases precipitously as St is increased from 0.01 to 10.},

abstract = {The development of a two-dimensional viscous incompressible flow generated from a circular cylinder impulsively started into rectilinear motion is studied computationally. An adaptive numerical scheme, based on vortex methods, is used to integrate the vorticity/velocity formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations for a wide range of Reynolds numbers (Re = 40 to 9500). A novel technique is implemented to resolve diffusion effects and enforce the no-slip boundary condition. The Biot-Savart law is employed to compute the velocities, thus eliminating the need for imposing the far-field boundary conditions. An efficient fast summation algorithm was implemented that allows a large number of computational elements, thus producing unprecedented high-resolution simulations. Results are compared to those from other theoretical, experimental and computational works and the relation between the unsteady vorticity field and the forces experienced by the body is discussed.},

abstract = {A new class of splitting schemes for incompressible flows is introduced. The new schemes are based on a weak form of the pressure Poisson equation and, at each time step, only require to solve a set of Helmholtz-type equations for the velocity and a Poisson equation (in the weak form) for the pressure, just as pressure-correction and velocity-correction schemes. However, unlike pressure-correction and velocity-correction schemes, the new splitting schemes are free of splitting errors and deliver full accuracy on the vorticity and the pressure. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Panel methods employing surface distributions of source and vortex singularities based on the solution of boundary integral equations have been extensively used for modeling external and internal aerodynamic flows. Part 1 describes the surface vorticity method and illustrates applications of this technique over a wide range of engineering problems in aerodynamics and turbomachines, including lifting aerofoils and cascades, mixed-flow and rotating cascades for fans, pumps or turbines, meridional flows in turbomachines, flow past axisymmetric bodies, ducts and ducted propellers or fans. Part 2 extends surface vorticity modeling to the fairly new CFM field of vortex dynamics or vortex cloud theory. Methods are developed, again from first principles, to deal with shear layers, boundary layers, periodic wakes, bluff-body flows, cascades and aerofoils including the use of stall control spoilers. A number of useful computer programs are included.},

abstract = {The aerodynamic behavior of a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) is analyzed by means of 2D particle image velocimetry (PIV), focusing on the development of dynamic stall at different tip speed ratios. The VAWT has an unsteady aerodynamic behavior due to the variation with the azimuth angle $\theta$ of the blade's sections' angle of attack, perceived velocity and Reynolds number. The phenomenon of dynamic stall is then an inherent effect of the operation of a VAWT at low tip speed ratios, impacting both loads and power. The present work is driven by the need to understand this phenomenon, by visualizing and quantifying it, and to create a database for model validation. The experimental method uses PIV to visualize the development of the flow over the suction side of the airfoil for two different reference Reynolds numbers and three tip speed ratios in the operational regime of a small urban wind turbine. The field-of-view of the experiment covers the entire rotation of the blade and almost the entire rotor area. The analysis describes the evolution of the flow around the airfoil and in the rotor area, with special focus on the leading edge separation vortex and trailing edge shed vorticity development. The method also allows the quantification of the flow, both the velocity field and the vorticity/circulation (only the results of the vorticity/circulation distribution are presented), in terms of the phase locked average and the random component.},

abstract = {The aim of the present paper is to introduce and to discuss inconsistencies errors that may arise when Eulerian and Lagrangian models are coupled for the simulations of turbulent poly-dispersed two-phase flows. In these hydrid models, two turbulence models are in fact implicitely used at the same time and it is essential to check that they are consistent, in spite of their apparent different formulations. This issue appears in particular in the case of very-small particles, or tracer-limit particles, and it is shown that coupling inconsistent turbulence models (Eulerian and Lagrangian) can result in non-physical results, notably for second-order fluid velocity moments. This problem is illustrated by some computations for fluid particles in a turbulent channel flow using several coupling strategies.},

@article{Barba2010a,
abstract = {A common problem in particle simulations is effective field interpolation. Field interpolation is any method for creating an accurate representation of a given continuous field by a linear combination of overlapping basis functions. This paper presents two techniques for field interpolation, based on a radial basis function (RBF) formulation using Gaussians. The application in mind is vortex methods, where one needs to determine the circulation (or strength) of individual vortex particles with known position and scale to represent a given vorticity field. This process is required both to initially discretize a given vorticity field, and to replace a configuration of particles with another for the purposes of maintaining spatial accuracy. The first technique presented is formulated as an RBF collocation problem, and obtains a solution accurately and with excellent algorithmic efficiency by means of a preconditioned iterative method. The preconditioner is a sparse approximation, based on localization, to the dense coefficient matrix of the RBF system. The second technique uses approximate solutions to the reverse heat equation, recognizing that the standard regularization used in vortex methods (estimating particle strengths using the local value of vorticity multiplied by particle area/volume) corresponds to a Gaussian blurring of the original field. A single time step is used, thus avoiding amplification of high frequencies, and accurate solutions are produced using explicit finite difference methods. Computational experiments were performed in two dimensions, demonstrating the accuracy and convergence of the proposed techniques. Application in three dimensions is straightforward, as radial basis function interpolation is neutral to dimension, but will require more computational effort. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A scheme treating diffusion and remeshing, simultaneously, in Lagrangian vortex methods is proposed. The vorticity redistribution method is adopted to derive appropriate interpolation kernels similar to those used for remeshing in inviscid methods. These new interpolation kernels incorporate diffusion as well as remeshing. During implementation, viscous splitting is employed. The flow field is updated in two fractional steps, where the vortex elements are first convected according to the local velocity, and then their vorticity is diffused and redistributed over a predefined mesh using the extended interpolation kernels. The error characteristics and stability properties of the interpolation kernels are investigated using Fourier analysis. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that the scheme can be successfully applied in complex problems, including cases of nonlinear diffusion. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

In the past three decades, research into the numerical analysis aspects of vortex methods has provided a solid mathematical background for understanding the accuracy and stability of the method. At the same time vortex methods retain their appealing physical character, which was the motivation for their introduction. This book presents and analyzes vortex methods as a tool for the direct numerical simulation of impressible viscous flows. It will interest graduate students and researchers in numerical analysis and fluid mechanics and also serve as an ideal textbook for courses in fluid dynamics.},

abstract = {The vortex core shed from rotorcraft blades maintains coherency - and thus dynamic relevance - many blade turns after its creation. This presents a challenge to traditional Eulerian computational methods, as fine grids are required to suppress numerical diffusion which would weaken the vortex cores after a small number of revolutions. Vortex methods have been used in the past to overcome these problems, as they require computational elements only in vorticity-containing regions, but suffer from greater computational cost per element. In the present work, we will solve these problems with a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian method for modeling rotor wakes. An Eulerian OVERFLOW overset grid method computes the near-body flow, while a Lagrangian particle vortex method tracks the wake. The vortex method uses an anisotropic LES model to handle subgrid-scale dissipation explicitly. The computational cost of vortex methods is alleviated by using a parallel adaptive treecode on a cluster of machines each with multi-core CPUs and multiple cost-efficient graphics processing units (GPUs). Simulations of a low-Re sphere, finite wing, and 4-bladed rotor model are presented and are validated by comparisons with computational and experimental data. © 2010 by Applied Scientific Research, Inc.},

abstract = {The aerodynamics of horizontal axis wind turbine wakes is studied. The contents is directed towards the physics of power extraction by wind turbines and reviews both the near and the far wake region. For the near wake, the survey is restricted to uniform, steady and parallel flow conditions, thereby excluding wind shear, wind speed and rotor setting changes and yawed conditions. The emphasis is put on measurements in controlled conditions. For the far wake, the survey focusses on both single turbines and wind farm effects, and the experimental and numerical work are reviewed; the main interest is to study how the far wake decays downstream, in order to estimate the effect produced in downstream turbines. The article is further restricted to horizontal axis wind turbines and excludes all other types of turbines.},

The first part of the paper is concerned with isotropic diffusion operators, whereas the second part will consider the general case of a nonconstant matrix of diffusion. In the former case, the approximation of the diffusion operator is much simpler than in the general case. Furthermore, we get two possibilities of approximations, depending on whether or not the integral operator is positive. CR - Copyright \&\#169; 1989 American Mathematical Society},

abstract = {Fourth order accurate methods of mehrstellen type are compared to second order accurate methods for the solution of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in their vorticity stream function formulation. These methods are applied to the study of separated flow around a circular cylinder at several Reynolds numbers. The impulsively started cylinder at Re = 200 and 550, is considered without symmetry restrictions. The features illustrated include the bulge phenomenon at Re = 200, the occurrence of secondary vortices depending on the schemes used at Re = 550, and of twin secondary vortices at Re = 3000. The Karman vortex street is investigated at Re = 200 with a uniform flow in the far field and with superimposed motions of the cylinder. In this last case, a frequency analysis has allowed a critical examination of results pertaining to locked-in situations with respect to confinement effects. © 1985.},

@article{Carnevale1997,
abstract = {<p>A vortex approaching a no-slip wall \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}rebounds\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} due to the creation of vorticity at the wall in a viscous boundary layer. Here it is demonstrated that a purely inviscid mechanism can also produce vortex rebound from a slip wall. In inviscid vortex rebound, vortex tube stretching generates the necessary vorticity to allow rebound, eliminating the need for viscous vorticity generation. This vortex stretching mechanism is demonstrated through numerical simulations and laboratory experiments on dipole-vortex rebound from a boundary. In an application to oceanography, numerical simulations of both quasi-geostrophic and shallow water dynamics are used to show that the beta-effect at an eastern boundary can produce this inviscid rebound. Through a series of numerical experiments in which the strength of the beta-effect is varied, a formula for predicting the point of separation of the vortices from the boundary in a dipole-coast collision is deduced. Through simulations, the flux of vorticity and fluid away from the boundary is measured as a function of beta and initial angle of incidence. It is found that, in contrast to viscous vortex rebound, which typically does not produce a flux of material away from the boundary farther than a distance comparable to the initial vortex radius, the beta-induced rebound does carry fluid far from the coast. Laboratory experiments in a rotating tank are used to show that a sloping bottom can also provide an inviscid mechanism for dipole-vortex rebound from the wall of the tank under certain conditions. A relation determining the conditions under which inviscid or viscous processes will dominate in the rebound of the dipole from a boundary is obtained.</p>

abstract = {Flow past elliptic cylinders is investigated for different Reynolds numbers and angles of attack by numerically solving the two-dimensional, unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. Results are obtained by using various numerical methods for consistency checks and also compared with available experimental results at Re = 3000. The Navier-Stokes equation is solved in stream-function-vorticity formulation using a finite difference method with third-and fifth-order upwinding for the convection terms. The pressure field is obtained by solving a Poisson equation and surface pressure values and vorticity information is integrated to obtain the sectional loads and pitching moment. Specific results are provided for Re = 3000 and 10 000 for different parameter combinations for the early stages of flow development. The effects of Reynolds number, angles of attack (a) and thickness to chord ratios (t/c) are discussed through this two-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS). © 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

The panel code is intended as a design and research tool to capture the 3D nature of a VAWT and its wake. The model contains methods to realistically treat blade-wake interactions, vortex stretching/contraction and viscous diffusion. Validation is demonstrated by comparison with 3D-stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and smoke trail studies for a straight-bladed VAWT. New insight into the near wake structure of a VAWT is developed in addition to how this structure changes as a function of tip speed ratio and height-diameter ratio. Tip vortex dynamics are also discussed.},

abstract = {We present numerical schemes for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on a primitive variable formulation in which the incompressibility constraint has been replaced by a pressure Poisson equation. The pressure is treated explicitly in time, completely decoupling the computation of the momentum and kinematic equations. The result is a class of extremely efficient Navier-Stokes solvers. Full time accuracy is achieved for all flow variables. The key to the schemes is a Neumann boundary condition for the pressure Poisson equation which enforces the incompressibility condition for the velocity field. Irrespective of explicit or implicit time discretization of the viscous term in the momentum equation the explicit time discretization of the pressure term does not affect the time step constraint. Indeed, we prove unconditional stability of the new formulation for the Stokes equation with explicit treatment of the pressure term and first or second order implicit treatment of the viscous term. Systematic numerical experiments for the full Navier-Stokes equations indicate that a second order implicit time discretization of the viscous term, with the pressure and convective terms treated explicitly, is stable under the standard CFL condition. Additionally, various numerical examples are presented, including both implicit and explicit time discretizations, using spectral and finite difference spatial discretizations, demonstrating the accuracy, flexibility and efficiency of this class of schemes. In particular, a Galerkin formulation is presented requiring only C0 elements to implement. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Lagrangian vortex particle method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations is essentially a meshfree method. For the satisfaction of the boundary conditions on a submerged body, however, the need to generate a mesh (on the boundary) remains, as the only known method is based on a paneltype formulation. Here, we propose an alternative method for satisfaction of the boundary conditions which is meshfree, and based on a radial basis function collocation approach. Radial basis functions are used both to calculate the vortex sheet on the body which cancels the slip velocity, and to solve the diffusion equation which transfers the vorticity from the solid wall to the fluid domain. Proof-of-concept calculations are presented on the impulsively-started cylinder at Reynolds numbers 200 and 1000. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, and further investigations are underway to assess overall accuracy and improve computational efficiency. Copyright © 2009 by the authors.},

abstract = {A series of numerical issues related to the analysis and implementation of fractional step methods for incompressible flows are addressed in this paper. These methods are often referred to in the literature as projection methods, and can be classified into three classes, namely the pressure-correction methods, the velocity-correction methods, and the consistent splitting methods. For each class of schemes, theoretical and numerical convergence results available in the literature are reviewed and open questions are discussed. The essential results are summarized in a table which could serve as a useful reference to numerical analysts and practitioners.},

@article{Carnevale1997,
abstract = {<p>A vortex approaching a no-slip wall \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}rebounds\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} due to the creation of vorticity at the wall in a viscous boundary layer. Here it is demonstrated that a purely inviscid mechanism can also produce vortex rebound from a slip wall. In inviscid vortex rebound, vortex tube stretching generates the necessary vorticity to allow rebound, eliminating the need for viscous vorticity generation. This vortex stretching mechanism is demonstrated through numerical simulations and laboratory experiments on dipole-vortex rebound from a boundary. In an application to oceanography, numerical simulations of both quasi-geostrophic and shallow water dynamics are used to show that the beta-effect at an eastern boundary can produce this inviscid rebound. Through a series of numerical experiments in which the strength of the beta-effect is varied, a formula for predicting the point of separation of the vortices from the boundary in a dipole-coast collision is deduced. Through simulations, the flux of vorticity and fluid away from the boundary is measured as a function of beta and initial angle of incidence. It is found that, in contrast to viscous vortex rebound, which typically does not produce a flux of material away from the boundary farther than a distance comparable to the initial vortex radius, the beta-induced rebound does carry fluid far from the coast. Laboratory experiments in a rotating tank are used to show that a sloping bottom can also provide an inviscid mechanism for dipole-vortex rebound from the wall of the tank under certain conditions. A relation determining the conditions under which inviscid or viscous processes will dominate in the rebound of the dipole from a boundary is obtained.</p>
