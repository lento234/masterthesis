@article{Huang2006a,
abstract = {A numerical investigation on the particle dispersion in the wake of particle-laden gas flows past a circular cylinder at Reynolds number of 105 is presented. In the numerical method, the Discrete Vortex Method with the diffusion velocity model is employed to calculate the unsteady gas flow fields and a Lagrangian approach is applied to track individual particles. A dispersion function is defined to represent the dispersion scale of the particle. The distributions of gas velocities and vortex blobs, the trajectories and dispersion functions as well as distributions for particles with various Stokes numbers ranging from 0.01 to 1000 are obtained. The numerical results show that: (1) very small sized particles with St = 0.01 can distribute both in the vortex core and around the vortex periphery, whereas intermediate sized particles with St = 1.0, 10 are distributed around the vortex periphery, and very large sized particles with St = 1000 do not feel the gas flow; (2) only at small Stokes number (St = 0.01, 0.1) the particles do not impact with the cylinder; (3) the particle's dispersion intensity decreases precipitously as St is increased from 0.01 to 10.},

abstract = {Bluff body flows controlled in various manners are simulated with a high-resolution, gridless vortex method. Two-dimensional, unsteady, viscous simulations are utilized to illuminate the physical phenomenon underpinning certain flows of this class. Flows past a rotationally oscillating circular cylinder and flows past an elastically mounted circular cylinder are studied, providing a variety of new insights about these systems. A computational method facilitating longtime, high-resolution vortex simulations is developed whose grid-free nature enables future extension to complex geometries. The significant fluid forces experienced by bluff bodies are of much practical concern and are induced by flowfields that are often complex. The studies in this thesis aim to contribute to the understanding of the relation between wake development and forces and how to exploit this relationship to achieve flow control. A circular cylinder undergoing rotational oscillation is known to experience a significant deviation in forces from unforced flow. Computations from Re=150-15000 verify past experimental observation of significant drag reduction for certain forcing parameters. These simulations also illuminate the mechanism which renders this control effective - a forced boundary layer instability triggering premature shedding of multipole vortex structures. New insights were also provided by studies of flow over a model of an elastically mounted cylinder. A two-dimensional cylinder modeled as a damped oscillator can serve as an approximation to three-dimensional situations such as a cable under tension. Simulations clarified the behavior of such a two-dimensional system and, contrary to a line of classical thinking, revealed an unexpected adaptivity in wake evolution. New scaling is also suggested which better classifies these systems under certain conditions. Vortex methods are well-suited for incompressible bluff body flow in many ways. However, the handling of viscous diffusion causes complications for such simulations. A relatively unexplored approach, the core expansion method, is studied, extended, and implemented in this work in order to balance accuracy with preservation of the gridless foundation of vortex methods. This viscous technique is found to enable long-time calculations that are prohibitive with other techniques while preserving a high level of accuracy.},

@article{Carnevale1997,
abstract = {<p>A vortex approaching a no-slip wall \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}rebounds\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} due to the creation of vorticity at the wall in a viscous boundary layer. Here it is demonstrated that a purely inviscid mechanism can also produce vortex rebound from a slip wall. In inviscid vortex rebound, vortex tube stretching generates the necessary vorticity to allow rebound, eliminating the need for viscous vorticity generation. This vortex stretching mechanism is demonstrated through numerical simulations and laboratory experiments on dipole-vortex rebound from a boundary. In an application to oceanography, numerical simulations of both quasi-geostrophic and shallow water dynamics are used to show that the beta-effect at an eastern boundary can produce this inviscid rebound. Through a series of numerical experiments in which the strength of the beta-effect is varied, a formula for predicting the point of separation of the vortices from the boundary in a dipole-coast collision is deduced. Through simulations, the flux of vorticity and fluid away from the boundary is measured as a function of beta and initial angle of incidence. It is found that, in contrast to viscous vortex rebound, which typically does not produce a flux of material away from the boundary farther than a distance comparable to the initial vortex radius, the beta-induced rebound does carry fluid far from the coast. Laboratory experiments in a rotating tank are used to show that a sloping bottom can also provide an inviscid mechanism for dipole-vortex rebound from the wall of the tank under certain conditions. A relation determining the conditions under which inviscid or viscous processes will dominate in the rebound of the dipole from a boundary is obtained.</p>

In the past three decades, research into the numerical analysis aspects of vortex methods has provided a solid mathematical background for understanding the accuracy and stability of the method. At the same time vortex methods retain their appealing physical character, which was the motivation for their introduction. This book presents and analyzes vortex methods as a tool for the direct numerical simulation of impressible viscous flows. It will interest graduate students and researchers in numerical analysis and fluid mechanics and also serve as an ideal textbook for courses in fluid dynamics.},

@book{Lewis2005a,
abstract = {Panel methods employing surface distributions of source and vortex singularities based on the solution of boundary integral equations have been extensively used for modeling external and internal aerodynamic flows. Part 1 describes the surface vorticity method and illustrates applications of this technique over a wide range of engineering problems in aerodynamics and turbomachines, including lifting aerofoils and cascades, mixed-flow and rotating cascades for fans, pumps or turbines, meridional flows in turbomachines, flow past axisymmetric bodies, ducts and ducted propellers or fans. Part 2 extends surface vorticity modeling to the fairly new CFM field of vortex dynamics or vortex cloud theory. Methods are developed, again from first principles, to deal with shear layers, boundary layers, periodic wakes, bluff-body flows, cascades and aerofoils including the use of stall control spoilers. A number of useful computer programs are included.},

@article{Chibbaro2009,
abstract = {The aim of the present paper is to introduce and to discuss inconsistencies errors that may arise when Eulerian and Lagrangian models are coupled for the simulations of turbulent poly-dispersed two-phase flows. In these hydrid models, two turbulence models are in fact implicitely used at the same time and it is essential to check that they are consistent, in spite of their apparent different formulations. This issue appears in particular in the case of very-small particles, or tracer-limit particles, and it is shown that coupling inconsistent turbulence models (Eulerian and Lagrangian) can result in non-physical results, notably for second-order fluid velocity moments.

@article{Carnevale1997,
abstract = {<p>A vortex approaching a no-slip wall \{$\backslash$textquoteright\}rebounds\{$\backslash$textquoteright\} due to the creation of vorticity at the wall in a viscous boundary layer. Here it is demonstrated that a purely inviscid mechanism can also produce vortex rebound from a slip wall. In inviscid vortex rebound, vortex tube stretching generates the necessary vorticity to allow rebound, eliminating the need for viscous vorticity generation. This vortex stretching mechanism is demonstrated through numerical simulations and laboratory experiments on dipole-vortex rebound from a boundary. In an application to oceanography, numerical simulations of both quasi-geostrophic and shallow water dynamics are used to show that the beta-effect at an eastern boundary can produce this inviscid rebound. Through a series of numerical experiments in which the strength of the beta-effect is varied, a formula for predicting the point of separation of the vortices from the boundary in a dipole-coast collision is deduced. Through simulations, the flux of vorticity and fluid away from the boundary is measured as a function of beta and initial angle of incidence. It is found that, in contrast to viscous vortex rebound, which typically does not produce a flux of material away from the boundary farther than a distance comparable to the initial vortex radius, the beta-induced rebound does carry fluid far from the coast. Laboratory experiments in a rotating tank are used to show that a sloping bottom can also provide an inviscid mechanism for dipole-vortex rebound from the wall of the tank under certain conditions. A relation determining the conditions under which inviscid or viscous processes will dominate in the rebound of the dipole from a boundary is obtained.</p>
