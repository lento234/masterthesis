    The work I present here will not have been possible with the support of my supervisors dr.ir. C. (Carlos) J. Simao Ferreira and dr.ir. A. (Artur) Palha da Silva Clerigo. I want to thank Carlos for the constant encouragement and ensuring that I didn't loose myself in the detail and to have a global picture. Thank you for also giving me fresh perspective when it seems impossible and making me to think outside the box. I want to thank Artur for his daily supervision and guidance to teach me all the intricate details for developing this numerical method. I also want to thank him for putting aside time to work hand-in-hand to find solutions to the problems I faced.
    
    I want to thank my friends: Chid, Thor, Oliver, Mark, Rob, Alberto, Hector and Dieter for spending time together at the university, tackling the challenge of finishing the master thesis together. You guys gave me joy during the work and it was fun working beside you guys. I want to thank my other friends you made by my last few years in Netherlands an enjoyable experience.
    
    Finally, I want to thank my family: Daddy, Mummy, Chechi, and Denis Chettan. Thank you for your patience and your unending love throughout my life.
