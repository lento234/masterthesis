%\section{Introduction to Hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian \\Vortex Particle Method}

\section{Summary of the approach by Daeninck and Stock}

% Summarize the sections. : domain decomposition, coordinate systems assosciated to each
% subdomains, and the coupled evolution of the hybrid method.
% Reference to the literatures: Cottet and others, stock and daenick
% We use approach of stock based on the phd research of daeninck

	\subsection{Decomposition of the domain}
	
	% Summary of the terminology
	% Schematic of the domain decomposition: general, and close-up.
	
		\subsubsection*{Coordinate Systems}
	
		% Coordinate system: local to global transformation.
		% summarize: coordinates systems of panels, lagrangian, eulerian
		% how is the body defined? How it the problem constructed? 


	\subsection{Coupling strategy used in literature}
		% Summarize daenincks approach:
			% Methodology, algorithm
			% Domain decomposition
		% Summarize stock's approach:
			% Methodology, algorithms
			% Resulted domain decomposition.
