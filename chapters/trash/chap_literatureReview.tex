\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{ch:LiteratureReview}

%This is a detailed part of the proposal that rigorously reviews what work has been already carried out by other academics in this area while also benchmarking industry best practice. The researcher is trying to establish: 1) what research areas are relevant, and 2) what the current understanding is along with any opposing views. It is very nice to end with some sort of synthesis of the presented State-of-the-art to link explicitly to the work in the proposal, especially with regard to the following Section. This might even include a statement of what the author sees their work adding to the body of knowledge.
