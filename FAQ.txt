This is a small list with FAQs and not-so-FAQs.

Q: Where can I find Latex packages on the internet?
A: http://www.ctan.org/search.html

Q: When running the example, Latex cannot find certain packages, what do I do 
now?
A: Use Miktex to install the missing packages.

Q: Long captions of figures and tables do not break over multiple lines, they 
only do that if hyperlinks are completely disabled (as in 'draft' mode), what 
can I do about this?
A: Add the option 'breaklinks=true', to the list of options of 'hypersetup', 
either in dutmsc.cls or in the preamble of the main latex file.

Q: I prefer to indent paragraphs instead of separating them by a small amount, 
can I change that and then, how?
A: In dutmsc.cls (around line 220), comment the following lines:

% separate paragraphs instead of indenting them
\setlength{\parskip}{\medskipamount}
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}

This will give the default behaviour again.

Q: The pdf output from the postscript to pdf converter has papersize 'letter',
how do I change that to 'a4'?
A: Add the option '-sPAPERSIZE=a4' to the command line of ps2pdf.
- In TeXnicCenter, modify the 'LaTeX => PS => PDF' profile as follows:
  "-sPAPERSIZE=a4" "%bm.ps" "%bm.pdf"
- In Kile:
  Settings -> Configure Kile -> Tools -> Build -> PStoPDF
  Options field: '-sPAPERSIZE=a4' '%S.ps' '%S.pdf'

Q: I have a chapter/appendix with more than 100 figures. In the list of
figures, the figure number overlaps the name of the title, i.e. the margin for
the figure number is too small. How can I correct this?
A: Either split the chapter/appendix in some more parts, or, if that's not an
option, do as follows:
Open dutmsc.cls and just before the line with
"\renewcommand\tableofcontents{%'
(somewhere in the beginning), add:

\renewcommand*\l@figure{\@dottedtocline{1}{1.5em}{2.3}}

Change "2.3em" into something somewhat bigger (3.0em or 3.3em). You will have
to experiment a little until it looks ok.
