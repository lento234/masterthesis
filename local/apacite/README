THE APACITE PACKAGE [2005/06/08]
================================

The apacite package (for LaTeX and BibTeX) attempts to capture the
requirements of the American Psychological Association concerning citations
and reference list as closely as possible. In addition, it provides a large
number of options and other possibilities for customization, so that a wide
range of citation styles and reference list styles can be handled.
Furthermore, it also provides the possibility of automatically generating an
author index.

The documentation of the apacite package is in the file apacite.pdf. This file
can also be generated by processing the file apacite.tex, which in this way
acts as an extensive test of the package. To get the references, the author
index, and the table of contents of apacite.tex right, the following list of
commands must be executed:

latex apacite
bibtex apacite
latex apacite
latex apacite
latex apacite
makeindex -o apacite.and apacite.adx
latex apacite
latex apacite
makeindex -o apacite.and apacite.adx
latex apacite

So 10 runs are necessary in order to get everything OK. Apart from this, the
url package (url.sty) must be available in a place where TeX can find it. This
is not necessary for the apacite package itself, but for the test examples
from the APA manual that are used in the document apacite.tex. Furthermore,
the index package (index.sty, available from CTAN; search for index.sty or
index.dtx) must be available in a place where TeX can find it. This is
necessary for the apacite package if an author index is requested, and this is
done in the document apacite.tex.

If you have a problem with the package/bibstyle that is not described in the
documentation, please locate it as specifically as possible and E-Mail me a
short but comprehensive description of the problem and the pieces of the .tex
and .bib files that seem to be invoking the problem. If I have time, I will
have a look and answer (and, I hope, solve the problem).

Good luck with it!
