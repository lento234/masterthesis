Directory lang/
===============

This subdirectory contains files that contain language-specific
modifications of apacite, mainly translations of terms like "and", "Ed.",
etc., and have been written by apacite users that are (native) speakers
of the languages involved. See the documentation for further details.
The following files are currently available (note that most of these
are also used for ``dialects'' in the sense of babel):

dutch.apc    -> dutch
english.apc  -> english
german.apc   -> german
greek.apc    -> greek
ngerman.apc  -> german (new orthography)
swedish.apc  -> swedish
