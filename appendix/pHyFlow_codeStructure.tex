%\begin{abstract}
The document outlines the \texttt{pHyFlow} code structure. The \texttt{pHyFlow} functions are organized into several classes. The functions related to the vortex particles are placed inside the \texttt{Blobs} class. The functions related to the panel problem are inside \texttt{Panels} class. The \texttt{LagrangianSolver} class is made to couple the functions of the vortex blobs and the vortex panel together. The functions of the Eulerian domain are placed inside the \texttt{EulerianSolver} class, where the Navier-stokes grid problem is solved. Finally, coupling of all the problems are done with the \texttt{HybridSolver} class. Note, all the classes are capable of handling multi-body / multi-domain problem within them and \texttt{LagrangianSolver} class and the \texttt{HybridSolver} class only couples methods together.\\
